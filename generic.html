							<h1>Voice Out Student Helpline Management System</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/voshes.png" alt="voshes.png" /></span>
							<p>One of the small scale project that i have worked on during my sophomore in college. I remember that my team decided to create this project as part of our requirements in my curriculum during the time of covid pandemic to provide a platform that can be used by the students to setup an appointment with the guidance counselor. In return, counselor can view their list of schedules which minimize and shorten the process. It involves a chat-based, and appointment scheduling features which enabled the user to interact with each other by providing a platform to counsel student during pandemic.</p>
							<p>Through this project i have a learned a lot with regards to PHP and SQL language.</p>

							<h1>Tea Creations POS & Inventory System</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/tcci.png" alt="TCCI.png" /></span>
							<p>It was my first project during my internship on Signopsys Inc. where my team was tasked to developed a Point-of-Sale with Inventory System. I was part of the back-end development team where i have learned AJAX and improved my Javasript skils. It has the features like most of the POS System available on the world, but it differs when it comes to the design as the front-end team develop a new look that was inline with the theme and vision of the company. My team used different libraries found on the internet speed up the development process of the projects such as Sweet Alert and Datatables.js</p>
							<p>Through this project i have improved my skills in SQL, PHP, javascript and learned different libraries which i can use for the websites that i will build in the future.</p>

							<h1>Computer College of Studies School Portal</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ccs_portal.png" alt="ccs_portal.png" /></span>
							<p>It is my Second school project which me and my team have created. I also worked as a back-end developer as our project instructor have tasked our team to create a school portal that will be used by the students, registrar, and accounting to view, update, and add, and delete information of the students. So, half of my team worked on front-end development while I started to develop the design of the database which by the way runs on the MySQLi server on XAMPP localhost. I learned how to properly design the relationships between tables and some tricks on Javascript and PHP</p>
							<p>This projects allows me to realize the importance of relationship between different tables on the databases.</p>

						<div class="inner" id="payroll">
							<h1>Payroll Management System</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/payroll.png" alt="payroll.png" /></span>
							<p>This is my second project during my internship with the Signopsys Inc. The boss of the company asked us to create a simple payroll management system to ease the process of payrolls for the accounting department. It will be used by the employee to time-in and time-out whereas, the accouting dept. will used this platform to automatically generate the calculation of the payroll of the employees. I have worked as a full-stack developer for this project to makes the development process much faster.</p>
							<p>Through this project i have the learned the importance of MVC or Model View Architecture and applied it in the back-end development.</p>
