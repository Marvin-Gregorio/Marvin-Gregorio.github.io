							<h1>Voice Out Student Helpline Management System</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/voshes.png" alt="voshes.png" /></span>
							<p>During my sophomore year in college, my team and I worked on a small-scale project as part of our curriculum requirements. Given the challenging circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to create a platform that would allow students to set up appointments with their guidance counselors remotely. Our project included chat-based and appointment scheduling features, which enabled students to interact with counselors and receive counseling during a time when in-person meetings were not feasible.</p>
							<p>As a result of this project, I gained valuable experience working with PHP and SQL languages. I learned how to design and develop a web application that included a secure login system, chat functionality, and appointment scheduling capabilities. Additionally, I developed my skills in database management and optimization, as we needed to ensure that counselor schedules were updated in real-time and that the system could handle a high volume of user requests.</p>
							<p>Overall, this project allowed me to apply the theoretical concepts I had learned in my courses to a real-world problem. It also taught me the importance of communication and collaboration, as my team and I worked closely with both students and counselors to gather feedback and ensure that the platform met their needs.</p>

							<h1>Tea Creations POS & Inventory System</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/TCCI.png" alt="TCCI.png" /></span>
							<p>During my internship at Signopsys Inc., my team was tasked with developing a Point-of-Sale system with an inventory management component. As a member of the back-end development team, I had the opportunity to learn AJAX and improve my JavaScript skills. Our system included many of the standard features found in POS systems, but what set it apart was its unique design. The front-end team developed a new look that aligned with the company's vision and brand identity, giving it a distinct visual appeal.</p>
							<p>To speed up the development process, my team made use of various libraries available on the internet, such as Sweet Alert and Datatables.js. By working together, we were able to create a seamless and functional system that met our client's needs.</p>
							<p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in SQL, PHP, and JavaScript. I also learned how to utilize different libraries to enhance the functionality and design of web applications. This project taught me the importance of collaboration between different teams to create a cohesive and visually appealing product while ensuring its functionality. Overall, this project was a significant learning experience that allowed me to improve my skills and prepare for future web development projects.</p>

							<h1>Computer College of Studies School Portal</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ccs_portal.png" alt="ccs_portal.png" /></span>
							<p>For my second school project, I was part of a team tasked with creating a school portal for students, the registrar, and the accounting department. As a back-end developer, my focus was on designing the database that would be used by the portal. While half of our team worked on front-end development, I delved into creating the design of the database, which was set up on a MySQLi server on XAMPP localhost.</p>
							<p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in properly designing the relationships between different tables in a database. This project allowed me to fully appreciate the importance of having well-defined relationships between tables, as this made it possible to efficiently manage and access student information. Additionally, I was able to pick up some tricks for using JavaScript and PHP in web development, which helped me to create a more functional and dynamic portal.</p>
							<p>Overall, this project was an important learning experience for me, as it helped me to develop my skills in database design and improve my proficiency in JavaScript and PHP.</p>

							<h1>Payroll Management System</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/payroll.png" alt="payroll.png" /></span>
							<p>This was my second project during my internship with Signopsys Inc., where our team was tasked with creating a payroll management system to streamline the payroll process for the accounting department. The system would allow employees to clock in and out, while the accounting department could use it to automatically calculate their payroll.</p>
							<p>For this project, I worked as a full-stack developer, which enabled me to contribute to both the front-end and back-end development. One of the most important things I learned from this experience was the importance of using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in developing web applications. Applying this architecture in the back-end development made the system more organized, efficient, and scalable.</p>
							<p>Overall, this project was an excellent learning opportunity for me, as it allowed me to further develop my skills in full-stack web development and gave me a chance to apply the MVC architecture in a real-world project. The experience I gained from this project has been invaluable in my journey as a web developer.</p>
